## **Introduction**

Having plans to build two factories and a laboratory in The Netherlands, the Dutch branch of pharmaceutical company Abbott needed a service company; an independent party to check on the engineering documents as they were developed by the main engineering firm. Although Cost Engineering's main track record was in oil & gas, they had already proven their abilities beyond that industry. Reason enough for Abbott to use their services to see if the documents for their plant were up to scratch. Two years later, the factories and laboratory were built to completion and fully operational. Although the original agreement covered the engineering drawings and documentation only, in the end Cost Engineering has also been responsible for all cost management activities during the project execution phase.

## **Estimating**

Going over the engineering documents, Cost Engineering came across some elements that could have implications for the cost estimate of the plant. Either because not all risks of the project were taken into account, or because of project circumstances that would inevitably lead to higher costs. The arguments they put forward resulted in their services for Abbott to expand to a full estimate validation and eventually a rigorous revision of the estimate itself.

## **Tender management**

The project included a significant amount of special equipment and materials as a result of the planned clean areas and labs in the plant. Since the standard tendering procedures that were put in place did not sufficiently appreciate those circumstances, the processes and procedures were improved with the help of Cost Engineering. They also organized a kick-off for all subcontractors to get them aligned and to ensure the fully understood the project and its requirements. This approach also helped to realize successful cost control from the early phases of the project.

## **The end result**

During the two years that followed, Cost Engineering was responsible for all cost control activities for the various disciplines that were involved in the project. Except for monitoring all costs related aspects, keeping track of scope changes and forecasting the total costs based on progress, Cost Engineering also proved their value through thinking along with construction. They suggested changes that had a significant positive impact on future maintenance costs. Upon completion, the project was delivered within time and budget.
